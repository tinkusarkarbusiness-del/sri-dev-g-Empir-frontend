/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Sri Dev Empire application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and uses a
 * presence-based model for admin roles. All write operations are protected by
 * authorization checks based on the authenticated user's UID.  Data validation is
 * relaxed in this prototyping phase to allow for flexible data shapes, but critical
 * authorization and relational integrity fields are strictly enforced.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. Access is restricted to the
 *   owning user.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: The existence of a document here grants admin privileges
 *   to the specified user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are strictly owned and readable only by the authenticated user.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed.
 * - Admin privileges are granted by document existence in /roles_admin/{userId}.
 * - To simplify and secure rules, authorization data is denormalized directly into
 *   documents, avoiding the need for costly or impossible `get()` calls.
